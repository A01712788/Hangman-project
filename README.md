# TicTacToe-project
Context
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game everyone's familiar with. It basically consists in 2 participants taking turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your own marks (either X or O) before your opponent does. 

I'll be trying to program a Tic tac toe game using python because first of all, I find its difficulty level appropriate to my current level / programming knowledge so far, and second of all, I think it is a project that can keep me engaged enough to keep learning new coding knowledge and enhance my current understanding of fundamental python concepts and gather experience by making mistakes and identify those erors to utilmately improve my programming skills.
